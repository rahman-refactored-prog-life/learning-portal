# Session Initialization - Load This First!

**IMPORTANT**: At the start of EVERY new session, ask Kiro to read this file first:
"Please read .kiro/SESSION_INIT.md to load the full project context"

This file tells Kiro to load all the context from previous sessions.

## Context Loading Instructions for Kiro

When you see this file, you MUST immediately read these files in order:

1. **Resume Context** (Quick overview):
   - File: `.kiro/session-state/resume-context.md`
   - Contains: Last session summary, next actions, current phase

2. **Context Summary** (Detailed state):
   - File: `.kiro/session-state/context-summary.md`
   - Contains: Complete project state, decisions, technical environment

3. **Current Phase** (Progress tracking):
   - File: `.kiro/session-state/current-phase.json`
   - Contains: Phase number, status, completed tasks

4. **Recent Conversation** (Last 200 lines):
   - File: `.kiro/session-logs/conversation-history.md`
   - Contains: Recent conversation history

5. **Tasks** (Current work):
   - File: `.kiro/specs/comprehensive-learning-portal/tasks.md`
   - Contains: All tasks with completion status

After reading these files, you should:
- Acknowledge what phase we're in
- State how many tasks are complete
- Mention the last thing that was accomplished
- Ask what the user wants to work on next

## How to Use This File

### At the Start of Each New Session:

1. **User says**: "Please read .kiro/SESSION_INIT.md"
2. **Kiro reads**: This file
3. **Kiro then reads**: All the context files listed above
4. **Kiro responds**: With current status and asks what to work on

### Example User Message:
```
Hi Kiro, please read .kiro/SESSION_INIT.md to load the full project context
```

### Example Kiro Response:
```
✅ Context loaded from previous sessions!

Current Status:
- Phase: Phase 1 - Foundation and Infrastructure
- Progress: 31/229 tasks (13.5%)
- Last Session: Fixed build issues, Node.js v22.12.0
- Build Status: ✅ Working perfectly

What would you like to work on?
1. Complete remaining Phase 1 tasks (3 left)
2. Start Phase 2: Java Complete Ecosystem
3. Test the application
4. Something else?
```

## Why This Is Needed

Without this file, Kiro starts each session "fresh" without knowledge of:
- What was accomplished in previous sessions
- Current phase and progress
- Technical decisions made
- Build configurations
- Issues that were resolved

This causes:
- ❌ Repeated questions about the same things
- ❌ Loss of context between sessions
- ❌ Frustration and wasted time
- ❌ Having to re-explain everything

With this file:
- ✅ Kiro loads all context automatically
- ✅ Knows exactly where you left off
- ✅ Remembers all decisions and fixes
- ✅ Can continue work seamlessly

---

## Troubleshooting

**If Kiro still doesn't have context:**
1. Make sure you asked Kiro to read this file
2. Check that all context files exist in `.kiro/session-state/`
3. Run `bash .kiro/hooks/session-resume.sh` to regenerate context
4. Provide the output of session-resume to Kiro

**If context files are missing:**
```bash
# Regenerate context from git history
bash .kiro/hooks/session-resume.sh

# Or manually check what exists
ls -la .kiro/session-state/
ls -la .kiro/session-logs/
```

---

**Remember**: Always start new sessions by asking Kiro to read this file!
