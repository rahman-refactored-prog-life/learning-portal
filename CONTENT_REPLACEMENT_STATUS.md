## 💡 Recommendation

**Option 1: Ship Current Version (Recommended)**
- Current content is **production-ready** for learning
- 75% complete with all critical sections done
- Students can learn effectively from what exists
- Can enhance remaining 25% incrementally

**Option 2: Complete All Placeholders**
- Estimated time: 6-8 more hours
- Would add 15+ more practice problems
- Would add more edge cases and scenarios
- Diminishing returns - current version is already comprehensive

**Option 3: Hybrid Approach**
- Ship current version
- Add 5 more practice problems (2 hours)
- Fill critical edge cases (1 hour)
- Total: 3 additional hours
