4. **The "Code"** + Multi-Language (5 languages) + Visualizations
5. **The "Practice"** + Comprehensive Assessment
6. **The "Gotchas"** + Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns
7. **The "Deep Dive"** + System Design Tie-ins

### Additional Layers (From Harvard)
8. **Interview Bank** (10+ FAANG questions per topic)
9. **Cheatsheet** (Quick reference)
10. **References** (Curated learning path)
